Important Note
This is a sample internal policy provided for demonstration/training purposes. It is not legal advice.

1. PURPOSE AND SCOPE

This policy defines baseline security requirements to protect ExampleCo information assets from unauthorized access, disclosure, alteration, or loss.

This policy applies to all employees, contractors, vendors, and third parties who access ExampleCo systems, networks, software, or data.

2. INFORMATION CLASSIFICATION

2.1 Classification Levels

2.2 Handling Requirements

PUBLIC: May be shared externally.
INTERNAL: Do not share externally without approval; store in approved systems.
CONFIDENTIAL: Encrypt in transit; restrict access; log access for key systems.
RESTRICTED: Strongest controls (MFA, strict access approvals, enhanced monitoring, least privilege).

3. ACCESS CONTROL

3.1 Authentication Requirements

- Unique user accounts are required (no shared accounts).
- MFA is required for remote access and administrative access.
- Passwords/passphrases must be strong (prefer length over complexity; recommended 14+ characters).
- Password changes are required upon suspected compromise, credential exposure, or as required by system risk.
- Account lockout or throttling is used to mitigate brute-force attempts.

3.2 Authorization Principles

- Principle of least privilege: Users receive minimum access necessary.
- Role-based access control (RBAC) for all systems.
- Access reviews conducted at least quarterly for critical systems.
- Immediate revocation upon employment termination.

3.3 Privileged Access

- Administrative accounts require additional approval.
- Privileged access sessions must be logged and monitored.
