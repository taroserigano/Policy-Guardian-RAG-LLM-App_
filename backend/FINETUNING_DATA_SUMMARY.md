## 🏗️ Training Data Structure

Each training example follows OpenAI's fine-tuning format:

```json
{
  "messages": [
    {
      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert compliance and policy analyst assistant. You provide accurate, detailed answers based on policy documents, regulations, and compliance requirements. Always cite specific sections, subsections, and exact requirements. Be precise with numbers, percentages, thresholds, and approval requirements."
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "What percentage price change requires senior leadership approval?"
    },
    {
      "role": "assistant",
      "content": "According to section 4.1 Pricing Strategy, price changes exceeding 15% require senior leadership approval. Category Managers have autonomous authority for price adjustments up to 15%, but anything beyond that threshold must be escalated for senior leadership review and approval."
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## ✅ Data Quality Characteristics

## 🚀 Next Steps: Fine-Tuning Process

### 1. Upload Training File to OpenAI

```bash
# Using OpenAI Python client
from openai import OpenAI
client = OpenAI()

training_file = client.files.create(
  file=open("training_data/compliance_finetuning_gpt4o_mini.jsonl", "rb"),
  purpose="fine-tune"
)
print(f"Training file ID: {training_file.id}")
```

### 2. Create Fine-Tuning Job

```python
fine_tune_job = client.fine_tuning.jobs.create(
  training_file=training_file.id,
  model="gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18",
  hyperparameters={
    "n_epochs": 3  # Default, can adjust based on validation results
  }
)
print(f"Fine-tuning job ID: {fine_tune_job.id}")
```

### 3. Monitor Progress

```python
# Check status
status = client.fine_tuning.jobs.retrieve(fine_tune_job.id)
print(f"Status: {status.status}")
print(f"Trained tokens: {status.trained_tokens}")

# List events
events = client.fine_tuning.jobs.list_events(fine_tune_job.id, limit=10)
for event in events.data:
    print(f"{event.created_at}: {event.message}")
```

### 4. Use Fine-Tuned Model

```python
# Once status is "succeeded"
completion = client.chat.completions.create(
  model=status.fine_tuned_model,  # e.g., "ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:org:custom:id"
  messages=[
    {"role": "system", "content": "You are an expert compliance and policy analyst assistant..."},
    {"role": "user", "content": "What percentage price change requires senior leadership approval?"}
  ]
)
print(completion.choices[0].message.content)
```

---

## 📊 Expected Fine-Tuning Metrics

- **Training Time**: ~30-60 minutes (164 examples)
- **Cost Estimate**: ~$5-10 (training) + usage costs
- **Training Tokens**: ~150K-200K tokens estimated
- **Validation Loss**: Target <0.5 for good fit
- **Epochs**: 3 (default), monitor for overfitting

---

## 🔍 Validation & Testing Plan

After fine-tuning completion:

1. **Threshold Questions**: Test all numerical thresholds (15%, $25, 95%, etc.)
2. **Multi-Step Processes**: Verify complex workflow responses
3. **Edge Cases**: Test decision-making on ambiguous scenarios
4. **Citation Accuracy**: Verify section references are appropriate
5. **Consistency**: Same question multiple times should give similar answers
6. **Hallucination Check**: Ensure model doesn't invent policies

### Test Questions to Validate:

- "What percentage price change requires senior leadership approval?" → Should answer 15%
- "What's the minimum category margin?" → Should answer 25%
- "What's the in-stock rate target?" → Should answer 95%
- "When should I escalate a vendor issue?" → Should provide clear criteria
- "How do I calculate forecast accuracy?" → Should provide formula

## 📈 Performance Comparison

**Before Fine-Tuning (Base GPT-4o-mini)**:

- Generic business advice
- May not know specific thresholds
- Less structured responses
- Requires more context in prompts

**After Fine-Tuning (Expected)**:

- Precise threshold answers (15%, 25%, 95%)
- Structured, actionable guidance
- Appropriate policy citations
- Consistent decision frameworks
- Better understanding of retail/category management context

---

## 🔄 Model Integration

Update backend configuration to use fine-tuned model:

```python
# backend/app/core/config.py
OPENAI_MODEL = "ft:gpt-4o-mini-2024-07-18:org:compliance:xxxxx"  # Fine-tuned model ID

# Or add as environment variable
FINETUNED_MODEL_ID = os.getenv("FINETUNED_MODEL_ID")
if FINETUNED_MODEL_ID:
    OPENAI_MODEL = FINETUNED_MODEL_ID
```
